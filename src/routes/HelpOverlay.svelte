		<h3 class="text-lg font-bold">What is this?</h3>
		<p class="py-4">This is GrvMkr (Groove Maker), a percussion grid notation tool. 
            It is designed to easily create grid notation, listen to the patterns, and print or save them as PDFs</p>
            
        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold">...but why?</h3>
		<p class="py-4">This is meant to replace Mango Drum, a discontinued old windows only software that does pretty much the same thing. 
            I have no affiliation with Mango Drum, I built this because I was asked nicely by my mother, and you must <strong>always</strong> do as your mother says.
